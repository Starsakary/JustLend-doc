# Wallet Integration Cooperation

JustLend DAO has established partnerships with prominent projects such as Tronlink, WalletConnect, and imToken. We have now opened an application portal for additional integrations. If your project is interested in collaborating with us, you can apply by clicking [Integration Application](https://forms.gle/caff61kBHXHicHsq8).

Once your application is approved, your brand name and logo will be prominently displayed in relevant sections when users link their wallets. This provides an excellent opportunity to enhance your brand’s visibility and connect with our user base.

Here’s an example of how logos are displayed for our existing Tronlink partners:
