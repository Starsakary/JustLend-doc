# Lowering the Collateral Factor of SUNOLD Market to 25%

#### Details:

1\. We are lowering the collateral factor of SUNOLD market to 25%.

We are planning to phase out the SUNOLD market. Currently we are at stage two, and going forward we may initiate proposals to further lower the collateral factor of the SUNOLD market.

#### Lowering the Collateral Factor

Lowering the collateral factor of the SUNOLD market from 50% to 25% means that the assets users are able to borrow by supplying the same amount of SUNOLD will shrink, and the account with SUNOLD enabled as collateral will be exposed to higher risks of liquidation. So please keep an eye on the risks associated with your account.
