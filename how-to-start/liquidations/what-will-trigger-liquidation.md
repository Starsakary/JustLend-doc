# What Will Trigger Liquidation?

Your account will be partially liquidated if the value of your borrowed assets exceeds the borrowing limit. This occurs when the value of your supplied assets falls or that of your borrowed assets rises.

If your account is in liquidation, the liquidator can repay up to 50% of your outstanding borrowed assets; the liquidator will receive a corresponding amount of your deposited assets (including an additional 8% bonus).

Therefore, please closely monitor your borrowing limit and borrowed assets.
