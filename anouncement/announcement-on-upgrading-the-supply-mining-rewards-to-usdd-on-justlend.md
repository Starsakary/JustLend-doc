# Announcement on Upgrading the Supply Mining Rewards to USDD on JustLend

Dear users:

&#x20;

In order to promote the health and sustainable development of the TRON ecosystem, TRON DAO Reserve and JustLend have entered into a strategic partnership. Both parties will actively explore and innovate to promote the diversified development of JustLend and provide users with more efficient services and more stable revenue.

&#x20;

JustLend supply mining rewards will be upgraded from JST to USDD, and JST will no longer be released through mining. USDD is an **over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin**, which is issued and custodied by TRON DAO Reserve, it is secured by the over-collateralization of multiple mainstream digital assets (e.g. TRX, BTC, USDT, USDC, and so on). The collateral ratio is up to 312%. At present, USDD perfectly circulates on TRON, Ethereum, BSC, and other networks via the cross-chain protocol BitTorrent Chain, Learn more about USDD at [https://usdd.io](https://usdd.io/#/).

&#x20;

After upgrading, the JustLend platform and JustLend users can enjoy the benefits of the USDD ecosystem:

* USDD as an over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin will greatly reduce the risks caused by market fluctuations, and ensure the stability of users' income and the security of their assets.
* USDD has a rich ecosystem, and users can gain higher benefits by participating in USDD ecological activities.
* USDD supports multi-chain circulation which can help users easily realize the assets cross-chain and meet the diverse needs of users.
