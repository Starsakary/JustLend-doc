# Smart Contracts

JustLend DAO Protocol contracts are divided in these repositories:

* **Supply and Borrow Market**: contains core contracts for JustLend DAO, including logic for supply and borrow market (SBM), interest rate model, governance, price oracle and comptroller.
  * **SBM**: enables supplying of crypto assets as collateral in order to borrow the _base asset_. Accounts can also earn interest by supplying the base asset to the protocol.
  * **Interest Rate Model**: users with a positive balance of the base asset earn interest, denominated in the base asset, based on a supply rate model.
  * **Price-Oracle**: contains the price oracle contracts we support, along with the logic validation for prices returned by these oracles.
  * **Governance**: contracts used for proposing, voting and executing proposals.
  * **Comptroller**: the risk management layer of the protocol. It determines how much collateral a user is required to maintain, and whether user can be liquidated.
* **Staked TRX**: the contracts utilized for staking TRX to earn high rewards.
* **Energy Rental**: contracts enable users to rent energy anytime with a low price.
