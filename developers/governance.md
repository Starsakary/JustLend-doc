# Governance

JustLend DAO protocol is governed and upgraded by JST holders. There are three components included in the governance system: [JST](https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TCFLL5dx5ZJdKnWuesXxi1VPwjLVmWZZy9)([WJST](https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TCczUFrX1u4v1mzjBVXsiVyehj1vCaNxDt/holders)) token, governance module([GovernorAlpha](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TH1SVVVU9NF1ans3CRBCJ5kW2yvn4sHP9b/code)) and [Timelock](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TRWNvb15NmfNKNLhQpxefFz7cNjrYjEw7x).

The governance of the JustLend DAO protocol is through proposals, whose process can be summarized as proposal posting-voting-taking effect. Several parameters are included in the process:

| Param             | Value     | Description                                            |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| quorumVotes       | 600000000 | The least for-votes for a proposal to take effect      |
| votingPeriod      | 86400     | Voting duration(block counts)                          |
| proposalThreshold | 200000000 | The least votes that a proposer must possess           |
| votingDelay       | 1         | The wating duration before voting starts(block counts) |
|                   |           |                                                        |
