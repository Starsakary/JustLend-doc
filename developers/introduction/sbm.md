# SBM

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

The JustLend DAO Supply and Borrow Market (SBM) is a decentralized  liquidity pool where users can participate as suppliers, borrowers or liquidators. Suppliers provide liquidity to a market and can earn interest on the assets provided, where borrowers are able to borrow in a collateralize assets way.&#x20;

The SBM contract is the main user-facing contract. Most user interactions with the JustLend DAO Protocol occur via the **Ctoken** contract. It exposes the liquidity management methods that can be invoked using either _**Solidity**_ or _**Web3**_ libraries.

`Ctoken.sol` allows users to:

* Supply
* Borrow
* Withdraw
* Repay
* Liquidation

The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/justlend/justlend-protocol/blob/main/contracts/CToken.sol).\
