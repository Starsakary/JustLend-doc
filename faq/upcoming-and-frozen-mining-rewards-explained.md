# "Upcoming" and "Frozen" Mining Rewards Explained

Your mining rewards consist of "upcoming" and "frozen" rewards. To understand what they are, you need to know how rewards on JustLend are distributed.

#### I.Distribution Rules of Supply Rewards

How the rewards of supply mining are distributed:

**1.Rewards of all markets (excluding USDD) are distributed in three phases:**

1\) Before January 21, 2022 at 21:00:00 (SGT), **supply mining rewards were given out in JST.** All rewards were unlocked in 24 weeks with 1/6 unlocked every 4 weeks, and the unlocked rewards were distributed at 4-week intervals, such as on February 22, March 22, April 19, etc.

2\) From January 21, 2022 at 21:00:00 to July 8, 2022 at 20:59:59 (SGT), **supply mining rewards were still given out in JST** but no longer needed 24 weeks to be completely unlocked. The rewards were distributed every 4 weeks, with all rewards accrued in the past 4 weeks being given out each time.

3\) After July 8, 2022 at 21:00:00 (SGT) , **supply mining rewards are given out in USDD**. The rewards will be distributed every 4 weeks, with all rewards accrued in the past 4 weeks being given out each time.

2.**Rewards of the USDD market are distributed in two phases:**

1\) From May 12, 2022 at 20:00:00 to July 7, 2022 at 19:59:59 (SGT), **supply mining rewards were distributed in JST and USDD** once a week in full on the next day after each week's mining ended. For example, if the first week of mining was from May 12, 2022 at 20:00:00 (SGT) to May 19, 2022 at 19:59:59 (SGT), the mining rewards would be paid out in full on May 20.

2\) After July 7, 2022 at 20:00:00 (SGT), **supply mining rewards are distributed in USDD** once a week in full on the next day after each week's mining ends.

#### II.Composition of " Upcoming" and " Frozen" Mining Rewards

Based on the rules above, it can be concluded that

**1."Upcoming" rewards include:**

1\) The unlocked but not yet distributed supply mining rewards (in JST) accrued before January 21, 2022, at 21:00:00 (SGT);

2\) The supply mining rewards (in USDD) accrued after July 7, 2022 at 21:00:00 (SGT) that have not been distributed.
