# How to understand your risk value?

Risk value is an indicator of the health of the current portfolio. Collaterals will be liquidated when the risk value reaches 100.

Formula: Risk value = Total borrow ÷ Borrow limit x 100

Our recommendations for users at different levels of risk are as follows:
