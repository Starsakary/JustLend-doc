# Announcement on Adjusting the Supply Mining APY of the USDD Market(2022-05-13)

Dear users,

The JustLend USDD Supply Mining has attracted a large number of investors since its launch at 20:00 on May 12, 2022, by 20:00 on May 13 2022, the total supply of the USDD market has exceeded 200 million US dollars.

The JustLend team analyzed the real-time data of the USDD supply mining and found that the APY had exceeded 100% in the past day by means of circular loans and leverage.

In order to maintain the stability of the USDD market and ensure the safety of investors' assets, JustLend will regularly adjust the APY of the USDD supply mining based on real-time data from 20:00 on May 13th. Our adjustment goal is: to keep the USDD supply mining APY (APY without leverage) around 30%(+-5%). At the same time, JustLend also calls on investors to pay attention to leverage risks and jointly maintain the stable and healthy development of the USDD market.

Thank you for your support.
