# Announcement on Adjusting the APY Algorithm of JustLend USDD Supply Mining(2022-05-29)

Dear users,

The JustLend USDD Supply Mining has attracted a large number of investors since its launch at 20:00 on May 12, 2022, by now, the total supply of the USDD market has exceeded 415 million US dollars.

The JustLend DAO team analyzed the USDD supply mining data and found that there was excessive use of circular loans and leverage. In order to maintain the stable and healthy development of USDD market and ensure the safety of investors' assets, JustLend DAO will adjust the APY algorithm of JustLend USDD supply mining from 20:00 on May 29: The APY of JustLend USDD supply mining will be calculated based on the investors' net supply (total Supply - total Borrow).

The adjustment only affects after the adjustment date, and the supply mining before the adjustment date will not be affected. The ultimate goal of our adjustment is: to keep the USDD supply mining APY (Net supply) around 30%(25% \~ 35%). At the same time, JustLend DAO also calls on investors to pay attention to leverage risks and jointly maintain the stable and healthy development of the USDD market.

Thank you for your support.

JustLend DAO Team
