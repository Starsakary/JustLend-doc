# Announcement on Upgrading the Supply Mining Rewards to USDD on JustLend(2022-07-06)

Dear users:

In order to promote the health and sustainable development of the TRON ecosystem, TRON DAO Reserve and JustLend have entered into a strategic partnership. Both parties will actively explore and innovate to promote the diversified development of JustLend and provide users with more efficient services and more stable revenue.

JustLend supply mining rewards will be upgraded from JST to USDD, and JST will no longer be released through mining. USDD is an **over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin**, which is issued and custodied by TRON DAO Reserve, it is secured by the over-collateralization of multiple mainstream digital assets (e.g. TRX, BTC, USDT, USDC, and so on). The collateral ratio is up to 312%. At present, USDD perfectly circulates on TRON, Ethereum, BSC, and other networks via the cross-chain protocol BitTorrent Chain, Learn more about USDD at [https://usdd.io](https://usdd.io/#/).

After upgrading, the JustLend platform and JustLend users can enjoy the benefits of the USDD ecosystem:

* USDD as an over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin will greatly reduce the risks caused by market fluctuations, and ensure the stability of users' income and the security of their assets.
* USDD has a rich ecosystem, and users can gain higher benefits by participating in USDD ecological activities.
* USDD supports multi-chain circulation which can help users easily realize the assets cross-chain and meet the diverse needs of users.
